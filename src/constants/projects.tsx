                <p>
                  I once watched a video on YouTube featuring an HR
                  professional. In it, they shared a story about screening CVs
                  from job applicants.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Out of <strong>900</strong> CVs submitted, only a handful
                  managed to meet <strong>80%</strong> of the criteria.
                </p>
                <LazyLoadImg
                  src={CVDECLINED}
                  alt="CV Declined"
                  height={250}
                  width={350}
                  className="object-cover object-center rounded-lg shadow-lg"
                />
                <p>
                  Those that reached <strong>60%?</strong> You could count them
                  on one hand. Sadly, the majority scored only{" "}
                  <strong>30-50%</strong>. ðŸ˜¢
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whatâ€™s even more disheartening is that CVs scoring just 50%
                  were still reviewed. The rest? Straight to the Recycle Bin.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Can you imagine the immense effort job seekers put in, only to
                  never even get the chance to be considered because their CVs
                  werenâ€™t optimized?
                </p>
                <div className="indent-0 text-pretty">
                  <p>
                    ðŸŽ¯ This is where the idea of <strong>Score CV Mu</strong>{" "}
                    was born.

                    <li>
                      âœ… Understand what recruiters are truly looking for.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      âœ… Assess how well their CV aligns with the required
                      criteria.

                      âœ… Receive actionable tips to increase their chances of
                      making their CV not just noticed but truly stand out.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
                <p>
                  With this tool, the hope is to eliminate the story of CVs
                  ending up in the Recycle Bin simply due to poor formatting,
                  irrelevant information, or a lack of visual appeal.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Everyone has potential, and that potential deserves to shine
                  through their CV.
