# ChatGPT Migrated to Remix?

Is anyone aware that ChatGPT doesn't use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) anymore?
It’s now using [Remix](https://remix.run/) instead.

If you don't believe me, try using **inspect element** and opening the **console**.
Type `window.`
and you'll see suggestions like this:

### Why Did ChatGPT Migrate from Next.js to Remix?

When I asked ChatGPT directly, it explained:

> “It's seems [Remix](https://remix.run/) was chosen for an improved **user experience**.”

It appears that ChatGPT's decision to migrate from Next.js to Remix centers on creating a better user experience.
Remix is known for its effective **server-side rendering (SSR)**,
reducing the need for **loading states** on the client side.

### What Makes Remix Special?

Remix is designed to minimize the amount of **[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)** on the client,
leaning more heavily on **standard web APIs** like the **[Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)** and **[FormData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData)**.
This approach helps make the application lighter and optimizes modern browser performance.
