# üìå What is Database Lock?

A **database lock** is a mechanism used to control access to data in a database. Its purpose is to prevent multiple users from changing the same data at the same time, thus avoiding conflicts or corrupted data.

## üîí Why Must It Be Locked?

- **Data Consistency**: Ensures data is always accurate and consistent.
- **Data Integrity**: Prevents data from being corrupted due to simultaneous changes (race conditions).
- **Optimal Performance**: Helps optimize database performance by organizing the order of data access.

## üîç Types of Database Lock

In general, there are two main types of database locks:

1. **Shared Lock (Read)**:

   - Given when a user wants to read data.
   - Multiple users can have a shared lock on the same data simultaneously.

2. **Exclusive Lock (Write)**:
   - Given when a user wants to change data.
   - Only one user can have an exclusive lock on certain data at a time.

## üí° Example

Imagine we have a table called "bank_account." If two users try to withdraw money from the same account at the same time without a lock, there could be a balance calculation error. With a lock, only one user can access the account at a time.

## üïí When Should Locks Be Used?

- **Transactions**: For operations (like money transfers) that must be treated as a single unit.
- **Updating Data**: When making changes to data in tables.
- **Concurrent Access**: When multiple users need to access the same data.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Careless use of database locks can lead to a **Deadlock**. This is a condition where two or more transactions are waiting for each other to release a lock, resulting in a standstill where no transaction can proceed.
