Have you ever encountered an issue where your code felt overly complex and lacked a clean, aesthetic structure?

If so, simplifying your code to improve its control flow can make it more effective and easier to manage.

## What is Control Flow?

Control flow refers to the order in which the instructions in your code are executed. It involves three main concepts:

- **Branching:** Runs specific lines of code based on conditions. Common keywords include `if` `else` `switch`
- **Looping:** Repeats specific lines of code while a condition is true. Common keywords include `for` `while`
- **Sequential processing:** Executes lines of code one after the other without branching or looping.

### Everyday Example of Control Flow

```js
if (weather === "rain") {
  useUmbrella();
}
GoOut();
```

## Why is this important?

Because with good control flow, we can:

- **Manage program flow more efficiently.**
- **Avoid unnecessary code repetition.**
- **Make logic more flexible and dynamic.**
