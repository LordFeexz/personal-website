# [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) in Production? Beware of Ransomware!

## What is [**XAMPP**](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)?

Why is its use in production causing so much controversy?

Actually, [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) is a popular software bundle for web development that includes [**Apache**](https://httpd.apache.org/), [**MySQL**](https://www.mysql.com/), [**PHP**](https://www.php.net/), and [**Perl**](https://www.perl.org/). [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) itself has confirmed that it is not secure by default and is not intended for production use, as it was designed to assist in development and testing processes only.

## Disadvantages of [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) include:

- **Security**: [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) has weak default security settings that can be easily exploited by hackers.
- **Performance**: [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) is not optimized for production environments, and its performance can be slow and unstable under high traffic.
- **Scalability**: [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) is not easily scalable to handle increasing traffic.

As an alternative, we can replace the use of [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) with a more stable and secure web server for production, such as [Apache HTTP Server](https://httpd.apache.org/) or [NGINX](https://nginx.org/en/docs/).
