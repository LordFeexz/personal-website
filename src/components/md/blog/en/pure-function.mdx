# ðŸŒŸ Pure Functions in Programming

Have you ever heard of a [pure function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function)? ðŸ¤”  
If not, a pure function is a function that always produces the same output if the inputs are the same and has no **side effects**.

This means that a pure function:

- Does not change data outside its own scope,
- Does not modify the parameters it receives,
- Does not depend on any external data that might change.

## âœ¨ Characteristics of a Pure Function

- **Deterministic**: The output depends only on the input. If the inputs are the same, the output must also be the same.
- **No Side Effects**: There are no changes to global variables, no altering of parameter values, and no interaction with external elements like databases or filesystems.

Pure functions help in making code more predictable and easier to test. They're commonly used in functional programming and are an essential concept in modern software development.
