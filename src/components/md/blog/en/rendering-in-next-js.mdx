## Have you ever heard of [**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org/)?

Currently, [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a very popular fullstack framework. [**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org/) is a JavaScript framework built on [**React.js**](https://reactjs.org/) designed to create fast and scalable web applications.

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) itself has several methods to render the application:

- [**Static Site Generation (SSG)**](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation): Creates pages at build time. This is ideal for infrequent or immutable content, such as on marketing pages or blogs.
- [**Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#server-side-rendering): Generates dynamic pages on each request. It's perfect for personalized content or real-time data needs.
- [**Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration): A combination of SSR and SSG, allowing gradual updating of static content without the need to rebuild the entire site.
- [**Client-Side Rendering (CSR)**](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/client-side): Renders the page completely in the browser using JavaScript/React, suitable for highly interactive or real-time pages.
- [**Partial PreRendering (PPR)**](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/partial-hydration): This is an experimental feature in Next.js that combines SSG and SSR by rendering static content directly and incrementally streaming for dynamic content.

Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages, so it is important for developers to understand these rendering methods to optimize applications.
