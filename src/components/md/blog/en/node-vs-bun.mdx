Node.js and Bun.js are JavaScript runtimes that can be used to build server-side applications. Node.js has long been the industry standard and has a very mature ecosystem, while Bun.js is a newcomer that includes many built-in tools, such as a runtime, package manager, and testing tools.

I created a simple test like this to measure their speed when running the following code:

The results were not much different.

However, it's important to note that Bun.js is multi-threaded, while Node.js is single-threaded.

This means that if code like the one above runs in Node.js, it will block all other processes. Although this can be mitigated by wrapping the above condition with a Promise.
