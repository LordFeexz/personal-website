# Currying in Functional Programming 🌟

Currying is a technique in functional programming in which a function with many arguments is transformed into a series of functions that each accept one argument.
This means that a function that initially requires multiple arguments,
after "currying," will become a sequential function, where each function requires only one argument and returns another function that is ready to accept the next argument.

## Example Currying in TypeScript

![example](/images/blog/curr-func-example.png)

In the example above, the `addEmployee` function is an example of implementing currying implicitly in TypeScript in the implementation of thunk Redux.
This can be seen from the structure of the function called incrementally, where the first function `addEmployee` receives data parameters and returns another function that receives `dispatch` and `getState` from Redux.
Then, this function generates a Promise that runs an async process.

## Benefits of Currying 🚀

**Reusability**: Allows the creation of new functions from existing ones by partially filling in the arguments. ♻️
**Function Composition**: Facilitates the arrangement of several functions together (function composition). 🔗
**Modular Code**: Allows for more flexible and modular code as each function focuses on only one argument. 🛠️
